 Mini Max Tic-Tac-Toe

This program allows a user to play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI that uses
a min-maxxing algorithm to guarantee that it always wins. The user begins
by choosing whether they want to start, if the AI should start, or let the
computer randomly decide. After that, they begin the game, and can make a
move by inputting a valid letter and a valid number in any order. After that,
the AI makes the best possible move against them. This continues until the AI
wins or ties. Once the game is done, the user is shown who won, and given a
choice to play again or end the program.
